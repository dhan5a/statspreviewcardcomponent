## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size


## My process

- I opted for a mobile first workflow and used display:flex for the desktop version. 

- I'm not too familiar with CSS Grid and therefore did not implement it in the final solution. 

- I used a filter to get the purple overlay over the image, but it looks a little different from the design.

- Also for the desktop version of the design(600px and more), the image is responsive to the browser size, but the text field remains the same. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learnt how to use media queries to create responsive designs.

### Continued development

I would like to learn CSS Grid, and how it can be used for responsive websites.
